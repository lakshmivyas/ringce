This repository contains the source for the www.ringce.com website. I have open sourced this as a reference implementation for the [hyde][hyde] generator. I don't intend to do collaborative development of the website, so please do not fork this repository :) If you want to make changes as a demonstration of hyde hacks, please fork the hyde repository and modify the default template or create your own template.
