### Here is how it all started ###

One week back I wanted to open source a few jQuery plugins that I use for my top secret project. I was debating between github and bitbucket and initially chose bitbucket since I wanted to give the under-hyped a fair chance. But I did find the github pages feature interesting and decided I was going to move to GitHub.

### Theres Jekyll ###

[Jekyll]({{links.Jekyll}}) is a really nice static website generator built by one of the git-hubbers. I started using Jekyll only to find that [Liquid]({{links.Liquid}}), the templating language used by Jekyll was not to my liking at all. 

Granted, I have been severely spoiled by [Django]({{links.Django}}), which is incidentally the [original inspiration]("http://archive.jvoorhis.com/articles/2005/10/01/shopify-templates-resemble-django") for liquid.
