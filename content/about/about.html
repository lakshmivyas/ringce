### About Ringce ###

Ringce is actually 5 Rings. The name is inspired by [A Book of Five Rings]({{links.5RingsBook}}) by Miyamoto Mushashi. I found the core idea of grouping swordplay strategies in line with 5 elements(Ground, Water, Fire, Wind and Void) fascinating. The same can be applied to software development or [anything in life]({{links.NatureTedTalk}}). Ringce is an exercise in applying the core idea to code, design and business.

### About Ringce.com ###

Ringce.com is a complex dynamic website rendered statically using the following tools:

1. [Hyde]({{site.url}}/products/hyde/hyde.html) was used for generating a static website from a complex dynamic template system.
2. Lot of the text is written using [markdown]({{links.Markdown}})
3. Icons and images were drawn using Adobe Illustrator.
4. Every character was typed in [Textmate]({{links.Textmate}}).
5. Initial styling was done with [CSSEdit]({{links.CSSEdit}})
6. Tweaking was done with [Xylescope]({{links.Xylescope}})

If you are more curious, the entire source code and articles are available at [GitHub]({{links.RingceGitHub}})
