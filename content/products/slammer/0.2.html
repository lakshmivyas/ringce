            Overview &amp; History
        </h1>
        <p>
            Slammer is a down to earth utility that displays a transparent grid that can be placed on top of applications during design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial requirement came to me when I had alignment issues on my website and none of the CSS Tools (Xylescope, CSSEdit) came with a built-in grid overlay. Firefox, however, had an add-in called GridFox which became the inspiration for this tool.
