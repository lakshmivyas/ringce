## Grids

Grids are paved roads that take you to mountains, seas & other unchartered
territories. {@class=blurb}

Slammer is the perfect vehicle that you can take through those paved
roads to layout your next design to perfection. Slammer’s grid overlays will blend
naturally with your design tools and workflow.

Whether you are designing for print, web, iPhone or Mac applications, you can layer
typographic grids, fibonacci series, harmonious sections and golden sections to
create layouts as simple or as complex as you want them to be.

## Tools

Slammer’s tools complement its grid layouts by allowing you to measure, inspect and
capture your design area. {@class=blurb}

Slammer’s measurement mode allows you to measure distances & angles with a simple
click and drag interface. Slammer has precise crosshairs that are visible on any
background and super useful magnifier.

Slammer can capture the area below the frame with or without the grid overlays.
Slammer’s grids can be exported as a composite PNG, as a Slammer template or in
the open JSON format
